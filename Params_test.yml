# Run parameters
do_simulation: 1          # Set to 0 to reconstruction previous simulation
do_reconstruction: 1      # Set to 0 to generate adq data only
divisions: 2              # Number os subprocesses for parallel simulation


# PET system (Vereos, Siemens_mCT, Discovery_ST, Discovery_STE, GE_Advance)
scanner: "Discovery_ST"
model_type: "cylindrical"


# Input and output directories
patient_dirname: "test_image" # Name of the directory in Data where phantoms are located
output_dir: "Test"            # Name of the Results Dir


# Variables needed for single simulation
act_map: "act.hdr"
att_map: "att.hdr"
center_slice: 7      # The slice number to be placed on the center of the scanner. If 0, automatically, the half of the slices will be calculated and used


# Variables needed for whole_body simulation
z_min: 75               # Only used in wholebody simulations (start of the acquisition, slice)
z_max: 316              # Only used in wholebody simulations (end of the acquisition, slice). 
# We calculate the number of beds based on (z_max - z_min) and the scanner FOV.


# Variables needed when running BrainViset

photons: 0                  # Set to 0 to do a realistic noise simulation
add_randoms: 1              # 1 activate Randoms simulation (Will force sampling_photons=0 and photons=0)
phglistmode: 0              # History Files from the phg module (Needed for LM reconstruction. Potentially very big)
detlistmode: 1              # History Files from the detector module (You need this for adding randoms. If add_randoms=1 will be forced)
