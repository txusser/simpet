#Define the simulation type and the environment
sim_type: "SimSET"        # SimSET, STIR or GATE (only SimSET working)


# Run parameters
do_simulation: 1          # Set to 0 to reconstruction previous simulation
do_reconstruction: 1      # Set to 0 to generate adq data only
divisions: 8              # Number os subprocesses for parallel simulation


# PET system (Vereos, Siemens_mCT, Discovery_ST, Discovery_STE, GE_Advance)
scanner: "Vereos"
model_type: "simple_pet" # Scanner Model (simple_pet, cylindrical)


# Input and output directories
patient_dirname: "brainViset_prueba" # Name of the directory in Data where phantoms are located
output_dir: "example_dir"            # Name of the Results Dir


# Variables needed for single simulation
act_map: "example_act.hdr"
att_map: "example_att.hdr"
center_slice:  153      # The slice number to be placed on the center of the scanner. If 0, automatically, the half of the slices will be calculated and used


# Variables needed for whole_body simulation
z_min: 75               # Only used in wholebody simulations (start of the acquisition, slice)
z_max: 316              # Only used in wholebody simulations (end of the acquisition, slice). 
# We calculate the number of beeds based on (z_max - z_min) and the scanner FOV.


# Variables needed when running BrainViset
maximumIteration: 5
pet_image: "pet.nii"   # Input PET image (from human subject)
mri_image: "mri.nii"   # Input MRI image (from human subject)
ct_image: "ct.nii"     # Input CT image  (from human subject)
# The three modalities are needed for running BrainViset

detlistmode: 0              # History Files from the detector module (You need this for adding randoms. If add_randoms=1 will be forced)
