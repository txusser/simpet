#Define the simulation type and the environment
sim_type: "SimSET"        # SimSET, STIR or GATE (only SimSET working)


# Run parameters
do_simulation: 1          # Set to 0 to reconstruction previous simulation
do_reconstruction: 1      # Set to 0 to generate adq data only
divisions: 6              # Number os subprocesses for parallel simulation


# PET system
scanner: "Discovery_ST" # Scanner Model (Vereos, Siemens_mCT, Discovery_ST, Discovery_STE, GE_Advance)
model_type: "cylindrical" # SimSET Model (simple_pet, cylindrical)


# Input and output directories
patient_dirname: "test_brain_FDG"   # Name of the directory in Data where phantoms are located
output_dir: "test_brain"       # Name of the Results Dir


# Variables needed for single simulation
act_map: "S1_actMap.nii"    # Activity map name
att_map: "S1_attMap.nii"    # Attenuation map name
center_slice: 153      # The slice number to be placed on the center of the scanner. If 0, automatically, the middle slice will be used


# Variables needed for whole_body simulation
z_min: 283               # Only for wholebody simulations (start of the acquisition, slice)
z_max: 584              # Only for wholebody simulations (end of the acquisition, slice).
# We calculate the number of beeds based on (z_max - z_min) and the scanner FOV.


# Variables needed when running BrainViset
maximumIteration: 5
pet_image: "pet.nii"   # Input PET image (from human subject)
mri_image: "mri.nii"   # Input MRI image (from human subject)
ct_image: "ct.nii"     # Input CT image  (from human subject)
# The three modalities are needed for running BrainViset


#SimSET Parameters (not used by STIR sim)
total_dose: 1               # mCi
isotope: "f18"              # For positron range. Options are f18, c11, n13, o15, ga68, rb82, zr89
simulation_time: 30         # secods
sampling_photons: 0         # Set to 0 to avoid importance sampling
photons: 0                  # Set to 0 to do a realistic noise simulation
add_randoms: 0              # 1 activate Randoms simulation (Will force sampling_photons=0 and photons=0)
phglistmode: 0              # History Files from the phg module (Needed for LM reconstruction. Potentially very big)
detlistmode: 0              # History Files from the detector module (You need this for adding randoms. If add_randoms=1 will be forced)
